        After completing Senior High School, I volunteered as an intern at a local basic school in Obuasi. During this time, I had the privilege of teaching over 154 students in Grade 4. My role involved guiding them in English Language, Integrated Science, and Social Studies, subjects critical for their foundational development. The experience was both challenging and fulfilling, as it demanded creativity, patience, and a genuine passion for impacting lives.

        Teaching such a large group required meticulous planning and adaptability, but it also opened my eyes to the disparities in education, especially in rural Ghana. Many of the students lacked basic learning materials and adequate infrastructure, yet their enthusiasm for learning was inspiring. This experience strengthened my resolve to address educational inequalities.
